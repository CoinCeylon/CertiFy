# CertiFy

A blockchain-based certificate verification system that creates tamper-proof digital certificates on the Cardano blockchain.

## What It Does

CertiFy solves certificate fraud by storing cryptographic hashes of PDF certificates on the blockchain, creating permanent proof of authenticity that cannot be tampered with.

### Core Features
- **Issue Certificates**: Upload PDF certificates and store their SHA-256 hash on Cardano blockchain
- **Verify Certificates**: Instantly verify if a certificate is authentic by checking blockchain records
- **Tamper Detection**: Any modification to a certificate changes its hash, making fraud detectable
- **Permanent Records**: Blockchain storage ensures certificates can't be deleted or modified

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Cardano wallet (Nami, Eternl, Lace, etc.)
- Blockfrost API key (free at [blockfrost.io](https://blockfrost.io))

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Setup
1. Get a free Blockfrost API key from [blockfrost.io](https://blockfrost.io)
2. Configure your API key in the app settings
3. Set your wallet to testnet mode (Preview/Preprod)
4. Get test ADA from the [Cardano testnet faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/)

## How It Works

### Issuing Certificates
1. Upload a PDF certificate
2. System calculates SHA-256 hash
3. Connect Cardano wallet
4. Transaction stores hash in blockchain metadata
5. Certificate hash is now permanently recorded

### Verifying Certificates
1. Upload certificate to verify
2. System calculates its hash
3. Search blockchain for matching hash
4. Instant verification result
